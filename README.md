# Memory Game

A memory game built using ReactJS.

## Description & Features

A simple memory game using 12 "cards". To play, try to click on as many cards as you can without clicking on the same one twice.

The game makes use of the ReactJS library. I used hooks to track and update state in my components. I also used this [FOSS Animal Crossing API](https://github.com/alexislours/ACNHAPI) to fetch the Animal Crossing villager character data that is used for the cards in the game.
