# Memory Game

A memory game built using ReactJS.

## How to Use

The simplest way to use this app is to visit the deployed site on [github pages](https://joshdevhub.github.io/Memory-Game/).

If you want to run this locally, just clone down the app, `cd` into the project, and run `npm install`. You can run the dev environment with `npm run dev`.

## Description & Features

A simple memory game using 12 "cards". To play, try to click on as many cards as you can without clicking on the same one twice. The game will keep track of your current score as well as the best score you've achieved so far.

The game makes use of the ReactJS library. I used hooks to track and update state in my components. I also used this [FOSS Animal Crossing API](https://github.com/alexislours/ACNHAPI) to fetch the Animal Crossing villager character data that is used for the cards in the game.
